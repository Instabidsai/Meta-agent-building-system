# Sales Discovery Bot - Meta-Agent Factory Build Record

**Agent**: sales-discovery-bot
**Build Date**: 2025-06-07 to 2025-06-08
**Status**: âœ… Unit Tests Passing, Integration Ready
**Key Innovation**: First agent with Claude-to-Claude testing

---

## Quick Reference for Future Builds

### What Worked
1. **Claude Sonnet 4** for conversational agents
2. **Trace capture** for debugging conversations
3. **Test personas** for rapid testing
4. **Single-stage processing** (not multi-hop)

### Common Fixes Needed
```python
# Pydantic v2
model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")

# LangGraph imports
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Datetime
datetime.now(timezone.utc)

# PostgreSQL (no +asyncpg)
postgresql://user:pass@host/db
```

### Must-Have Endpoints
```python
POST /chat                          # Main conversation
POST /test/conversation             # For Claude testing
GET /conversation/{id}/trace        # See reasoning
GET /health                         # Service status
```

### Test Command
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"persona": "dentist"}'
```

## Patterns to Reuse

### 1. Conversation State Machine
- One node processes current stage
- Always END after response (wait for user)
- Track stage transitions in traces

### 2. Business Logic Extraction
- Use dedicated tool functions
- Extract after 2-3 questions
- Store in structured format

### 3. MVP Proposal Generation
- Template-based but personalized
- Include specific metrics
- Clear next steps

## Metrics
- **Build Time**: 3 sessions (~6 hours)
- **Fix Attempts**: 12 major fixes
- **Test Coverage**: 100% unit, 0% integration
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500

---

## Next Steps for This Agent
1. Run full integration tests
2. Test with multiple personas
3. Deploy to Kubernetes
4. Add monitoring dashboards

---

## Factory Improvements Made
1. Added trace capture pattern
2. Created test persona system
3. Documented dependency issues
4. Built Claude-specific patterns
