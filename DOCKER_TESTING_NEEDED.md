# Docker-Based Testing Implementation Needed

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: Streaming implemented, testing blocked by MCP limitations

## Problem

The Meta-Agent Factory's autonomous test-fix loop is broken because:
- Windows MCP `execute_command` doesn't return output properly
- Can't verify if generated code actually works
- Can't see error messages to fix issues
- Breaks the "zero human intervention" promise

## What Was Completed

1. **Streaming is now MANDATORY** for conversational agents
2. **Templates updated** with streaming patterns
3. **Sales Discovery Bot v3.0** has full implementation
4. **Documentation** explains why streaming is critical

## Solution: Docker-Based Testing

Implement Docker containers for testing because:
- Consistent Linux environment
- Better command output capture  
- Logs can be retrieved with `docker logs`
- Fits the K8s deployment model
- Can be fully automated

## Implementation Approach

```python
# Instead of:
result = execute_command("python test.py")

# Use:
container = docker.build(".", tag="test")
result = docker.run("test", command="python test.py")
logs = docker.logs(container_id)
```

**Critical**: Without working tests, the Meta-Agent Factory can't verify code quality.
